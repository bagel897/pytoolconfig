# Pytoolconfig

**Py**thon **Tool** **Config**uration

The goal of this project is to manage configuration for python tools, such as
rope and add support for a pyproject.toml configuration file.
[Documentation](https://pytoolconfig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) This library
only supports python 3.8 to 3.12. 3.13+ may work, but isn't tested.

## Development

`pdm install --dev -G :all` to setup development environment `pdm run tox` to
run tests

## Alternatives
